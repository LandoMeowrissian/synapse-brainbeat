<h2>
 The synapse/brainbeat is simple step sequencer synthesizer and drum machine made with Tone.js and React
</h2> 

<h3>synapse</h3>
<p> synapse is the top grid and synthesizer component </p>
<p> the synthesizer is a basic synthesizer with a sawtooth oscillator made using Tone.Synth() </p>

<h3>brainbeat</h3>
<p> brainbeat is the bottom grid drum machine component </p>
<p> slightly more complex than its counterpart, the drum sounds were made using a variety of synths available in the Tone.js library</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>kick/toms - The kick drum and toms use the Tone.MembraneSynth() with sinewave oscillators and employ a variety of octaves to achieve distict tonality</p>
  <p>hit-hats - The hi-hats use the Tone.MetalSynth()</p>
  <p>snare - My personal fav. The snare drum is a combination of the Tone.MembraneSynth(), Tone.NoiseSynth(), and Tone.Filter(). </p>
 </li>
</ul>
