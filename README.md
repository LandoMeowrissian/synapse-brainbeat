<h2>
 The synapse/brainbeat is simple step sequencer synthesizer and drum machine made with Tone.js and React
</h2> 

<h3>synapse</h3>
<p> synapse is the top grid and synthesizer component </p>
<p> The synthesizer is a basic synthesizer with a sawtooth oscillator made using Tone.Synth() </p>
<p> The synthesziser grid uses the F#minor pentatonic scale. If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it. There are no "wrong" notes.</p>

<h3>brainbeat</h3>
<p> brainbeat is the bottom grid drum machine component </p>
<p> Slightly more complex than its counterpart, the drum sounds were made using a variety of synths available in the Tone.js library</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>kick/toms - The kick drum and toms use the Tone.MembraneSynth() with sinewave oscillators and employ a variety of octaves to achieve distict tonality</p>
  <li>
  <p>hit-hats - The hi-hats use the Tone.MetalSynth()</p>
   
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>snare - My personal fav. The snare drum is a combination of the Tone.MembraneSynth(), Tone.NoiseSynth(), and Tone.Filter() </p>
   
  </li>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Each grid consists of 6 voices represented by rows, and 16 steps represented by columns</p>
<p>The steps are subdivided by 8th notes allowing the user to create and loop 8count phrases</p>
<p>Click the buttons to toggle the sound on, click again to toggle the sound off</p>

<p>Use the slider to adjust the tempo (be gentle or she will get sad)</p>
<p>Click the start button to start the loop</p>
<p>Click the stop to stop the loop</p>

<h3>roadmap</h3>
<p>The sky's the limit! I have all kinds of plans for this. This includes, but is not limited to:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>user profiles</p>
   <p>saving loops</p>
  <p>all the normal features one would expect from a synthesizer & drum machine</p> 
  <p>a visulizer would be cool</p>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>contribute</h3>
 <p> I need all kinds of extra hands on this project. </p>

<h3>star power</h3>
<p>You made it this far, you might as well star and watch this repo! </p>
